# 🤖 Bots – Automation & Interaction Projects

This folder contains bot projects developed using **Discord.js** — each tailored for interaction, utility, or moderation within Discord servers.  
The structure is modular and scalable, allowing easy expansion for future bots on different platforms (e.g., Telegram, Slack, WhatsApp).

## 🎯 Purpose

- Build interactive bots for messaging platforms  
- Automate tasks, manage communities, and deliver real-time responses  
- Experiment with command handlers, events, and API integrations  
- Practice Node.js and asynchronous programming

## 🛠️ Current Stack

- **Discord.js** – Node.js library for building Discord bots  
- **Node.js** – Backend runtime  
- **npm** – Package management  
- **dotenv** – Environment variable configuration  
- **Command/Event handlers** – For modular architecture

## 📁 Example Bots
