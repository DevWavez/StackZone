# 🚀 StackZone – Project Showcase

Welcome to **StackZone**, my central hub for all the web projects I’ve built — from small frontend tools to fullstack applications deployed on platforms like **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or via custom backend setups.

## 📁 What You'll Find Here

Each folder in `StackZone` represents a standalone project.  
Some are frontend-only (like calculators or portfolio pages), others are complete fullstack apps with server logic and database integration.

Project types include:

- 🌐 Static sites and portfolio pages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- ⚛️ React and Next.js apps
- 🔧 Backend tools with Node.js, Express, and APIs
- 🧩 Micro-projects and UI experiments
- 🗂️ Fullstack projects with databases and authentication

## 🛠️ Technologies

A few of the tools and frameworks you'll see in use here:

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TailwindCSS, TypeScript  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB  
- **Deployment**: Vercel, Netlify, Firebase, Docker  
- **Tools & Services**: GitHub, Figma, Postman, Supabase

## 🌍 Live Versions

Whenever available, projects include links to deployed live demos, setup guides, and usage notes.

## 🧭 Goals

- Build real-world-ready applications  
- Explore different technologies through experimentation  
- Sharpen development workflows & deployment strategies  
- Create reusable templates and shareable tools
