# 💼 Portfolio Projects

This folder contains all of my portfolio-related web projects — designed to present skills, experience, and creative work in a structured, user-friendly way.  
Each subfolder may feature a personal portfolio website, design mockup, interactive CV, or showcase for freelance/academic work.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Build and refine responsive portfolio websites  
- Experiment with layout, interactivity, and branding  
- Present projects in a clean and accessible way  
- Practice deployment workflows for professional use

## 🛠️ Technologies

These projects typically use:

- **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**  
- **React** or **Next.js** for interactive layouts  
- **TailwindCSS**, **styled-components**, or SCSS  
- Deployment platforms: **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or GitHub Pages

## 📁 Example Projects

- `personal-site/` – My main developer portfolio with tech stack overview  
- `cv-interactive/` – A clickable, animated résumé with section-based scrolling  
- `freelance-showcase/` – Selected client projects displayed in gallery format

## 🌍 Live Demos

Most portfolio sites are deployed for public access — links are included inside each project folder's README.

## 📌 Notes

This folder is part of [`StackZone`](../) — a collection of my web development projects.  
Portfolio sites here are designed with clarity, performance, and simplicity in mind.
